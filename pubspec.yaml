# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at

# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Prompt
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Prompt/Prompt-Light.ttf
        # - asset: assets/fonts/Prompt/Prompt-Regular.ttf
        # - asset: assets/fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
        #   style: assets/italic
    - family: Syne
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Syne/static/Syne-Regular.ttf
        # - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
